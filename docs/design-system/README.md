# @yohaku/design-system

**[English](./README.md) · [简体中文](./README.zh.md)**

Yohaku design system: static design contract for the Yohaku monorepo — one accent, three neutral tiers, the rest is whitespace. Web pages, long-form, letters, reports — anywhere words live.

- Live showcase: **[yohaku.innei.dev](https://yohaku.innei.dev)**
- The iOS client that uses this contract lives in [`apps/mobile/`](../apps/mobile/)

> Each preview is split diagonally — light on the top-left, dark on the bottom-right.

## Principles

The whole system is built around **writing**. A page unfolds like a letter opening — text and silence form the rhythm, never crammed into a rigid grid. When you read, your eyes lead. The page follows.

**Color is restrained.** Light mode sits near the off-white of real paper. Dark mode sinks into warm gray, like reading by a small lamp at night. Accent appears only inside content; buttons, navigation, borders all step back.

**Animation breathes.** Content surfaces with the scroll rather than popping in — like turning a fresh page. First visit plays the full entrance; return visits skip it.

**Type has texture.** Headings carry the weight of serif ink; annotations and dates use italic serif, like margin notes. The base size is deliberately small. Space goes back to the content.

**Interaction is quiet.** No floating color blocks, no jumping highlights. Hover deepens color slightly — like a finger pressing on paper. Every response says *I noticed you*, not *look here*.

## Output samples

`pnpm demo:pdf` (from the repository root) renders three common written formats from the same tokens — same paper, same serif, same breathing rhythm.

| Type | About | 中文 | English |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| **Long-form post** | Serif body / drop cap / multi-page | [HTML](https://yohaku.innei.dev/demos/demo-post.html) · [PDF](https://yohaku.innei.dev/demos/demo-post.pdf) | [HTML](https://yohaku.innei.dev/demos/demo-post.en.html) · [PDF](https://yohaku.innei.dev/demos/demo-post.en.pdf) |
| **Resume** | A4 single page · designer-engineer CV | [HTML](https://yohaku.innei.dev/demos/demo-resume.html) · [PDF](https://yohaku.innei.dev/demos/demo-resume.pdf) | [HTML](https://yohaku.innei.dev/demos/demo-resume.en.html) · [PDF](https://yohaku.innei.dev/demos/demo-resume.en.pdf) |

## Install as a package

```bash
pnpm add @yohaku/design-system
```

```css
/* in your Tailwind v4 entry CSS */
@import "@yohaku/design-system/tokens.css";
```

That single import wires up the color / type / spacing tokens — pair it with the invariants in [`CHEATSHEET.md`](./CHEATSHEET.md).

## Local preview

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev             # local showcase preview (http://localhost:5173)
pnpm build           # bundle the showcase to design-system/showcase/dist
pnpm check           # token drift + template lint
pnpm test            # run the check.ts unit tests
pnpm demo:pdf        # render the demo essay / résumé / report to PDF
```

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/tokens.css` | Color / type / spacing tokens (Tailwind v4 `@theme`) |
| `SKILL.md` | AI routing rules (mockup / new component / mockup→React / token audit) |
| `CHEATSHEET.md` | One-page reference: ten invariants + color/type tables |
| `references/` | Full specs (tokens / components / anti-patterns / mockup-to-react) |
| `templates/` | HTML mockup starter |
| `showcase/` | Live showcase source |

## As an AI skill

[`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) is a routing contract for agents like Claude Code or Codex. When you say *"make a Yohaku mockup"*, *"convert this mockup to React"*, or *"audit token compliance"*, it pulls the right slice of `CHEATSHEET.md`, `references/`, and `templates/` into context so the agent ships against the same tokens.

The simplest install is to drop this whole directory into your agent's skill path (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/yohaku-design/`), then trigger it from a normal prompt:

- make a Yohaku-style mockup for X
- convert this mockup to React
- design a new Button variant
- audit this file for token compliance

Full contract: [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) and [`CHEATSHEET.md`](./CHEATSHEET.md).

## Spec at a glance

| Token | Light | Dark |
|-------|-------|------|
| Accent | 浅葱 `#33A6B8` | 桃 `#F596AA` |
| Surface | `#fefefb` (paper white) | `rgb(28,28,30)` (warm night) |
| Neutral | `1–10` (three tiers: surface / border / text) | auto-inverts |
| Easing | `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` | same |
| Base font size | 14px | same |

More in [`CHEATSHEET.md`](./CHEATSHEET.md).

## Background

Yohaku wasn't designed from scratch — it was filed down inside my own blog [Shiro](https://github.com/Innei/Shiro), one decision at a time. The original itch was just typography: replace the template-y card grid with something closer to letter paper, and let long-form text breathe. The longer I worked on it, the more obvious it became that the system was running on a few simple invariants — one accent, three neutral tiers, a breathing easing curve, and the rest is whitespace.

Later I came across [tw93/kami](https://github.com/tw93/kami) — same instinct: a constraint language, a single tonal register, and a bias toward the written word. Kami lands in static documents (PDFs, slides); Yohaku lands in webpages and long-form. Each one was a sanity check on the other. Pulling those invariants out of the application — into tokens, templates, and an AI skill — is what the design-system became: a contract you can hand to an agent or to another human and trust the output.

## Dev chats (open archive)

While building Yohaku, the AI-assisted chats were often more useful than the final code, so I'm sharing them in [archive/specstory-sessions](../archive/specstory-sessions/README.md), grouped by year.

## Acknowledgements

- The HTML design language was inspired by [tw93/kami](https://github.com/tw93/kami) — its writing-first, restrained-whitespace sensibility is an important starting point for Yohaku's typography.
